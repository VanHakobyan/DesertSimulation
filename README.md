Coyotes and pocket mice have lifetimes after which they would die and hence
no longer exist in the desert. The lifetime indicates the number of iterations
that the animal can pass through before dying of natural causes.
Coyotes and pocket mice also have a starvation period, which indicates the
number of iterations that the animal can pass through without eating before it
dies. Similarly, animals have a dehydration period that they cannot exceed
without drinking. When an animal dies, it is replaced by an empty space.
Coyotes and pocket mice also have different gestation periods (number of
iterations) after which they will give birth to new coyotes and pocket mice.
When the end of a gestation period is reached, a new animal shall be created.
The newborn animal shall be randomly placed in one of the eight neighboring
cells. If none of these cells are empty, the newborn would die.
